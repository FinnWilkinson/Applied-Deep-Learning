# Applied-Deep-Learning

Repository for labsheets an a final paired coursework project for 4th year University of Bristol Applied Deep Learning unit. Mark Achieved : 

For the coursework project, a peer and I had to replicate results from a 2016 by Pen et al titled *Shallow and Deep Convolutional Networks for Saliency Prediction*. Implementing the shallow architecture descibed in the paper, we produced a deep learning engine that predicted the Saliency maps for visual attention of input images. Using PyTorch, we aimed to replicate their accuracy results and then improve upon them via a change to the learning model (architecture or otherwise). 
Full details of the project aims, implementation and results can be found in: `/Final Project/Report`.
